# Red/Black Portfolio Template

A lightweight, accessible personal site template with a dramatic red/black theme.

## Structure
- `index.html` — Sections for Hero, About, Services, Projects, Contact.
- `styles.css` — Theme variables, responsive layout, and accessibility-focused styles.
- `script.js` — Mobile nav toggle, smooth scroll, minor UX helpers.
- `favicon.svg` — Minimal red/black icon.

## Quick start
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Replace placeholders like "Your Name", email, links, and project details.
3. Edit colors in `styles.css` if you want a different red or backgrounds.

## Customize
- Update nav links in `index.html` if you add/remove sections.
- Swap the hero art by editing `.grid-art` backgrounds or add an image.
- Replace `favicon.svg` with your own mark.

## Deploy
You can host this anywhere. Options:
- GitHub Pages: push to a repo and enable Pages.
- Netlify/Vercel: drag-and-drop the folder or connect the repo.
- Any static host.
